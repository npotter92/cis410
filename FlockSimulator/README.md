Flock Simulator - Manual
-------------------------------------------------------------
Alignment Weight:
    The higher the value for this option, the more the flock members will tend to move in a similar direction
    as the other flock members around them.
Cohesion Weight:
    The higher the value for this option, the more the flock members will tend to fly towards the center of
    mass of the other flock members around them.
Separation Weight:
    The higher the value for this option, the more the flock members will tend to fly away from individual
    flock members around them.
Number of flockers:
    Number of members of the flock, value from 5 to 50.
Speed:
    The speed at which the members of the flock move.
Dimensions:
    This option makes the flock members flock in either three dimensional space or two dimensional space.
Number of frames:
    The number of frames to key for the particular simulation
Flocking distance:
    The maximum distance between flock members where the flocking behaviors will begin to occur between them.
